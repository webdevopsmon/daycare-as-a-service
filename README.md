This repo is supposed to allow anyone to spin up the needed software solutions for an organization to be able to
- communicate
- keep track of files
- categorize files
- document processes
- mangage knowledge
- identity and access management

The name arises from the need of my children's daycare to implement all of those because up until we joined that daycare they were still relying on mail, email, groupchat and paper, but were in need for some proper digital support.
This repo will include everything you need to spin up all of the forementioned. Each folder contains a config for nginx, a docker-compose file, an .env.example and other config files you might need for the specific services. If needed it will include another readme-file.
